Portfolio — Anand Dubey

Hey there, I'm Anand Dubey, a B.Tech CSE student at Bennett University, and this is the digital window into my creative side. Within this project, you'll find my passion for web development—crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—all tied together into a portfolio that showcases my style, skills, and personal journey in tech.

What’s Inside

A sleek, responsive portfolio built from scratch with clean, semantic HTML structure.

Stylish, modern CSS that brings visual flair and smooth user experience.

Thoughtful and interactive touches powered by JavaScript to make browsing feel engaging.

Why I Built It

I’ve always been drawn to building things that people interact with—be it ideas or interfaces. This portfolio is my way of pairing design and functionality: to present my work beautifully, and also make it easy for anyone visiting (like recruiters or collaborators) to explore and connect.

See It Live

I've hosted it on Vercel, so you can explore the live version right here: Portfolio Website 

Let’s Connect

I’d love to chat more about what I’m working on or explore any creative ideas you have in mind—so feel free to reach out!

What’s Next

I'm always learning and growing—next up, I’m planning to dive deeper into interactive web projects, maybe pick up a modern front-end framework like React or Vue. I’m excited to keep expanding my skills and creating things that matter.

Thanks for stopping by—and happy browsing!
Anand Dubey
